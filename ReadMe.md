# _Automation Framework_

This is a java selenium framework which is using testng, maven, extent report, selenium, java, etc to achieve different tasks.

[Sample Test Video](framework-generate-sample-report)   
[Execution Settings](src/test/resources/config/Config.properties)

### _Project Features_
- Supports parallel test.   
- Multiple browsers can be setup.

- Read data from Properties file, Excel, JSON files.
- Real time reporting using ELK.
- Option to run on docker grid, local, zalenium or selenoid.
- On-demand browser instance creation using [Dynamic Selenium Grid 4](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium).
- On-demand browser instance creation using [Zalenium](https://opensource.zalando.com/zalenium/).
- Run using [JenkinsFile](src/test/resources/Jenkins/Jenkinsfile).

### _Project Components_
Below are the component details of the framework:

- #### Browser interaction using
    `selenium`

- #### Test Data
    Supports to read and maintain data from multiple file types like:
    -  Properties File
    -  Excel File with the help of [ApachePOI Jars](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.poi/poi/)
    -  JSON File

-   #### Test Scripts
    [TestNg](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.testng/testng/) is used as a test framework in order to generate test script taking into account   the `Page Object Model` design pattern.

-   #### Build Tool
    Using `maven`, project dependencies are managed. Test can be run using `pom.xml` and `testng.xml`.

-   #### Reporting
    Generates html report automatically by using [Extent Report 5](https://www.extentreports.com/docs/versions/5/java/index.html).
    By attaching screenshots and execution videos of the failed test cases.<br/>
    However, user can set the framework to take screenshots and videos of passed or/and skipped test cases. All reports are generated in `reports-test-output` folder. Report automatically opens in default browser.     
    **Note:** Exception logs and fail reasons are added to the report as well. All images are in Base64 and videos in mp4.

-   #### Utilities
    Holds common methods to re-use in order to achieve maximum re-usability.

-   #### Test Runner
    -   Tests can be executed in parallel and in cross browsers by using:
        - [pom.xml](pom.xml)
        - [testng.xml](testng.xml)
        - Jenkins
    -   Tests can be executed using:
        - local browsers
        - remote browsers
        - docker selenium grid
        - selenium grid
        - selenoid
        - zalenium
    

-   #### Other Components
    - [JavaMail API](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.sun.mail/javax.mail) and [JavaBeans(TM) Activation Framework](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/javax.activation/activation) is used to send the test report automatically on email using gmail or outlook. However, user can still decide if report has to be send or not.<br/>
      **Note:** Framework allows passwords in `Base64Encode` only.
    - All framework settings are done in properties file, making it easy for a non-technical user.
    - User can opt to run the test with their web drivers placed in drivers folder or with WebDriverManager.


### Getting Started:
1. Set all the properties/setting in [properties file](src/test/resources/config/Config.properties).
2. Run pom.xml or testng.xml file.

### Settings for Properties file
[Path to properties file](src/test/resources/config/Config.properties)

-   `url` of the test environment.
-   `environment` where the test has to be performed.
-   `testername` inorder to keep track.
-   `downloadwebdriver` to decide if tester want to place the drivers or wants the framework to download it with the help of [WebDriverManager](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/io.github.bonigarcia/webdrivermanager).
-	`runmode` decides whether to run test cases on local, grid (/ docker-grid), zalenium or selenoid. Accepts yes or no.
     -  if `runmode` is yes then user has to provide the remote url in `remoteurl`.
-   `environment` which is to be tested.
-   `testername` name of the tester.
-   To delete old report data:
    ```
    deleteoldreports - to elect if tester wants to delete old reports. Accepts yes or no.
    numberofdays - if yes than how old the files should be. Value in number of days.
    ```   
-   `overridereports` to elect if tester want all reports to be merged in one i.e., current reports plus old ones or create new report for each test suite run. Accepts yes or no.
-   Screenshots:
    ```
    passedscreenshot - to take screenshot of passed test cases. Accepts yes or no.
    ```
-   `retryfailedtestcases`to re-run fail test cases. Accepts yes or no. Not recommended setting to set it as yes.
-   Email details to send report:
    ```
    sendmailafterexecution - to send report. Accepts yes or no.
    sendmailusing - to choose from gmail or outlook.
    emailid - sender's email id.
    emailpassword - sender's password in Base64Encode only.
    receiversemailid - receiver's email id.
    ```   
    **Note**: In order to use gmail then enable [Allow less secure apps](https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps?pli=1&rapt=AEjHL4M-tPfEQqsOBVtOWL9wQTcuoh6uNQC7kNHqA1IgKKctttT5U20uTAcW3mpM7VQfCoTrdrwVnEpKLMfkCsRkGPUziWpq5A)
-   Setup real time report using ELK:   
    ```
    useelk - to enable using real time reporting using ELK. Accepts yes or no.
    elksuiteurl - url of the elastic search data add.
    ```
    **Note:** To use ELK, set the schema to have below keys:
    -   TestName
    -   Status
    -   ExecutionTime
        
        **Note:** More fields can be added and changes should be done accordingly in ELKUtils.java

### How to set up:
- [Selenoid](SetupReadMe/Selenoid.md)  
- [Docker Selenium Grid](SetupReadMe/Docker-Selenium-Grid.md)   
- [Dynamic Selenium Grid](SetupReadMe/Dynamic-Selenium-Grid.md)

### Notes:
1.	For Jenkins to support extent reporting (or other CSS, etc. components ) run below in scripts `https://jenkisURL/script`
      `System.setProperty("hudson.model.DirectoryBrowserSupport.CSP","")`	
2. Uses [lombok](https://www.baeldung.com/lombok-ide).
